## Overveiw 
Cleaning cryptocurrency data and using unsupervised machine learning to categorize the data. Data was first processed, cleaned, and then reduced using PCA. Cryptocurrency coins where then clustered using K-means, and data was visualized on both a 3-D and scatter plot (*see crypto_clustering.ipynb for reference*).
